                Like on any sports, rules are very important and they many of them. In order to play the sport, people should know the
                following: 
                </p>
                <ol class='decimal'>
                <li>
                    There can only be eleven player per teams, only two teams play against each other at the same time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A maximun of three substitutions are allowed on Official game matches such as League games and Cup matches, only on International 
                    friendly matches and on pre-season matches are allowed to have from five to seven substitutions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The match total duration is ninety (90) minutes, which are played in two halfs of forty five(45) minutes with fifteen (15) minutes of half break.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There should be no aggressions to other player. If a player commits
                    a foul, depending on the degree of aggression or how the fault was done, the referee can gives the player either a warning, a 
                    "<span class='color2'>Yellow Card</span>" or a "<span class='color1'>Red Card</span>". Yellow cards are not as important as red cards, the difference between them are:
                    <ol class='letter'>
                        <li>
                            A yellow card gives a player a warning that if another foul of the same degree is committed than he'll be booked with a second 
                            yellow card which will be equal to having a red card.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            On international Friendly matches, yellow card are 'NOT' accumulated. But, on leagues and cup matches, yellow card are accumulated. 
                            If a player accumulates four yellow cards gets a one match suspension.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Red card will send the player automatically off the field leaving the team with ten player, no substitution can replace the player
                            dismissed, and also he will miss the next match. A team with more than five red cards in one match, will be declare as a automatic loose to that team.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
